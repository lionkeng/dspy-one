Warranty Exclusions
1. Damage caused by failure to maintain the home according to Acme Homes guidelines is excluded from coverage and must be repaired at the homeowner's expense.
2. Cosmetic items such as minor scratches, small nail pops, or slight paint variations reported after thirty days are not covered by the warranty.
3. Acts of nature, including storms, floods, earthquakes, or other natural disasters, fall outside the scope of the warranty unless otherwise stated in writing.
4. Problems arising from homeowner modifications or do-it-yourself projects that alter the original construction details void related portions of the warranty.
5. Damage caused by pests or insects is excluded, so homeowners should schedule regular pest control services to protect their investment.
6. Appliance warranties provided by manufacturers take precedence; Acme Homes does not cover failures resulting from misuse or neglect of these products.
7. Normal wear and tear on finishes, flooring, or fixtures does not constitute a warrantable defect, though Acme Homes may offer advice on proper upkeep.
8. Failures of systems or components that exceed the specified warranty term are excluded, even if discovered after the coverage period has expired.
9. Secondary damage resulting from a covered issue, such as water staining from a plumbing leak, may not be covered if prompt action was not taken.
10. Any item installed after closing by the homeowner or a third party is not covered, and resulting damage to the home will be considered outside the warranty.
