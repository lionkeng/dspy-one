Appliance Warranty Coverage
1. Acme Homes provides a one-year service warranty on major appliances supplied with the home, including the refrigerator, range, dishwasher, and built-in microwave.
2. After the first year, homeowners must contact the appliance manufacturers directly, but Acme Homes will help with documentation needed for any extended warranties.
3. Appliances are warranted to function properly when used under normal residential conditions and maintained according to the instructions provided by each manufacturer.
4. Installation issues such as improper gas connections or electrical wiring faults discovered within the first year will be corrected at no cost to the homeowner.
5. Damage resulting from misuse, neglect, or attempts to repair appliances without authorization voids the warranty for that item.
6. Appliance finishes are covered for defects at delivery, but scratches, dents, or discoloration caused by cleaning products are excluded from coverage.
7. Range hoods and ventilation systems are included in the first-year service warranty to ensure they remove cooking odors and moisture efficiently.
8. Water supply and drain connections for dishwashers or refrigerator ice makers are warranted against leaks due to installation errors within the first year.
9. Homeowners must register their appliances with the manufacturers to take full advantage of extended parts coverage and recall notifications.
10. Acme Homes recommends keeping all appliance manuals and warranty documents in a safe place to expedite service requests should issues arise after the initial year.
