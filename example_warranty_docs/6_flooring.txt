Flooring Warranty Coverage
1. Hardwood flooring is protected for one year against buckling, warping, or separation caused by improper installation; homeowners must maintain indoor humidity levels within the recommended range.
2. Tile flooring is covered for cracks or loose tiles resulting from installation errors or defective adhesives, provided heavy impacts have not damaged the surface.
3. Carpeted areas are warranted against seam separation and significant wrinkles for one year, so long as proper cleaning methods are followed by the homeowner.
4. Vinyl plank or sheet flooring installed by Acme Homes is covered against curling edges or gaps due to installation faults, not wear from high traffic.
5. Grout and caulk in tiled areas are included in coverage for adhesion issues within the first year but require routine sealing by the homeowner to remain effective.
6. Stair treads and risers receive coverage for squeaking or shifting caused by inadequate fastening during construction, giving owners safe access between floors.
7. Flooring transitions and baseboards are warranted against pulling away or improper alignment, provided they have not been struck by heavy objects or altered by renovations.
8. Acme Homes will repair or replace sections damaged by adhesive failure or subfloor movement that falls under warranty guidelines.
9. Damage from pets, spills, or harsh cleaning chemicals is excluded from coverage, so homeowners should follow manufacturer recommendations for care.
10. Any flooring replacement due to warranty service will match the original materials and design as closely as possible but may show minor color variations due to age or availability.
