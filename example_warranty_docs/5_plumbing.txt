Plumbing Warranty Coverage
1. Interior water supply pipes are warranted for one year against leaks or bursts caused by faulty fittings or poor installation practices by Acme Homes.
2. Drainage lines are included in coverage for proper slope and secure connections to prevent backups, provided homeowners avoid flushing unsuitable materials.
3. Water heaters installed by Acme Homes carry a one-year labor warranty in addition to any longer manufacturer coverage for the tank and heating elements.
4. Sump pumps and associated discharge piping are protected from installation defects; routine testing is recommended to ensure these systems remain ready during storms.
5. Bathroom and kitchen fixtures are covered for consistent water pressure and leak-free operation when used in a normal residential manner.
6. In areas subject to freezing temperatures, outdoor hose bibs must be winterized by homeowners, as freeze damage is specifically excluded from warranty service.
7. Gas lines installed to serve appliances or fireplaces are warranted against leaks or improper connections, contingent on annual inspection by a qualified professional.
8. Acme Homes will address sewer line blockages discovered within the first year if they result from construction debris or incorrect grading of the pipes.
9. Water filtration or softener systems provided by the builder are covered for installation issues, though filter replacements and routine maintenance are the homeowner's duty.
10. The warranty does not cover clogs or damage resulting from misuse, neglect, or attempts to modify plumbing systems without prior written approval from Acme Homes.
