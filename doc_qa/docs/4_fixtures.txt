Fixtures Warranty Coverage
1. Acme Homes warrants installed light fixtures for one year against defects in workmanship or wiring; homeowners must change bulbs as needed to maintain functionality.
2. Faucets in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry areas are covered against leaks or dripping caused by improper installation, provided normal cleaning practices are followed.
3. Shower enclosures, including doors and hardware, are protected from failure or misalignment for one year, assuming no aftermarket modifications are made.
4. Toilet fixtures and flushing mechanisms are warranted for consistent operation free from leaks or clogs that stem from installation errors rather than misuse.
5. Built-in ventilation fans are covered for proper operation and noise levels, so long as filters are replaced and vents remain clear of obstructions.
6. Acme Homes includes doorbell and security system wiring under this warranty to ensure adequate signal and response for the first year of ownership.
7. Bathroom accessories such as towel bars and toilet paper holders are included, but damage caused by overloading or misuse voids coverage.
8. The warranty for kitchen sink garbage disposals includes repair of electrical or plumbing connections, provided foreign objects are not introduced into the unit.
9. Ceiling fans installed by the builder are covered for motor operation and secure mounting, with routine cleaning and blade balancing performed by the homeowner.
10. If any fixture manufacturer offers a longer warranty period, Acme Homes will assist with claims during the first year, after which owners should contact manufacturers directly.
