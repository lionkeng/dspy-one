Warranty Claim Procedure
1. Homeowners should gather photos, purchase documents, and a detailed description of the issue before submitting a warranty claim to Acme Homes.
2. Claims must be filed through the Acme Homes customer portal or by mailing a written request to the warranty department within the coverage period.
3. Once a claim is received, a service coordinator will reach out within five business days to schedule an inspection and confirm the nature of the problem.
4. Emergency issues involving safety or major leaks will receive priority scheduling, typically within twenty-four hours of claim submission.
5. During the inspection, homeowners should provide access to the affected area and note any previous repairs or modifications that may be relevant.
6. Acme Homes will determine if the issue is covered and, if so, arrange for qualified contractors or technicians to address the defect at no cost to the homeowner.
7. If a claim is denied, homeowners will receive a written explanation outlining the reasons for denial and steps that might be taken outside the warranty.
8. For approved claims, work orders will be generated, and homeowners will receive estimated timelines for completion along with contact information for the assigned contractor.
9. After repairs are finished, homeowners must sign a completion statement verifying that the issue was resolved and the area restored to an acceptable condition.
10. Homeowners who disagree with a resolution may request a second review by the warranty manager or escalate the matter according to the dispute resolution process outlined in the general terms.
